    why: "Under the WHS Act 2011, every business (as a PCBU) must manage risk so far as is reasonably practicable. Without a documented system you can't demonstrate you've met that duty — and you're exposed the moment something goes wrong. A right-sized system is your evidence, your induction tool and your defence, all at once.",

    summary:
      "Risk assessments and Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) are where safety gets specific. We work through your high-risk activities, apply the hierarchy of controls, and produce clear, task-level documents your crews can actually follow — not generic templates that sit in a drawer.",
    why: "SWMS are legally required for the eighteen categories of high-risk construction work under the WHS Regulation 2017, and risk assessments underpin nearly every duty you hold. Done well, they prevent incidents and give supervisors a defensible record. Done as a copy-paste exercise, they fail workers and inspectors alike.",

    why: "In an incident investigation or a SafeWork NSW inspection, your documentation is the first thing scrutinised. Gaps, out-of-date forms or missing records shift the burden onto you.

    why: "You can't manage what you don't measure. Regular audits and inspections catch drift before it becomes an incident, satisfy your due-diligence obligations as an officer, and give you the evidence that your system works in practice — not just on paper.",
